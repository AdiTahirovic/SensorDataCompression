SensorDataCompression is a engineering research project in which the aim is to make sensor data utilization effective.
Sensors samples dozens of data without being compressed. The compression take place within the application where the amount of sensor data is is huge compared to the compressed version of sensor data eg. jpeg.
In this projekt we try to use algorithms which are able to compress sensor data within the sensor and not in the application level.
The goal is to minimize overhead and send only the data which is essential to make application work and get rid of trivial data.
